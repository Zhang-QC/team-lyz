Protein Search
************************



This project aims to automate the traditional labor-consuming
protein search process. Through integrating protein database
websites, protein visualization softwares and statistcal 
coupling analysis tools, our project successfully creates an
user-friendly interfrace that allows users to pull essential
biological information and statistical analysis result about 
the protein of interest within a relative short period of time.
